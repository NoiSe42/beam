## WORK IN PROGRESS (BEAM 2.0 friendly)
Upon completion of a run, a folder named "results" will be created in the same path of your BEAM executable.
Within the "results" folder, all the runs' folders will be stored with the SAME BASENAME OF THE INPUT FILE.

e.g. if you called BEAM with "-f important_data.fb ... " 
	you will find a folder with this path: 
		results/important_data/
		
The structure of the results folder is the following:
results/
	<fileBaseName>/
		cooccurrence.png
		MI.png
		<backgroundFile>
		<inputFile>
		distance_peaks.txt
		** <baseName>_summary.nuc.txt
		** <baseName>_summary.txt
		benchmark/
			** motifs/
			(mask<N>/ if -k T)
		webLogoOut/
			motifs/
			(mask<N>/ if -k T)			
		distance/
			
Description of each element (a prepending "**" means that it stores a good amount of the information one is probably looking for:

	<baseName>_summary.txt (and .nuc, if -N t, BEAM1.6.1 and higher)
		It contains a summary of the run
		bin : Length-Structure bin as per (Pietrosanto et al. 2016 and Mattei et al. 2015)
		
		#motif=N
		BEAR consensus if present
		
		#qBEAR
		qBEAR consensus (easier to interpret)
		
		pvalueMW=pvalue of MannWhitney U Test against 
			the null hypothesis that the two samples of partial scores of the RNA with the motif
			and the partials scores of top scoring background with the model PFM (alignment with MBR, substitution matrix of secondary structures)
			come from the same distribution. Specifically H0 : P(MotifScore > BGscore) = P(MotifScore < BGscore)
		U= MannWhitney U statistic
		AUC=derived from the U statistic, it rates the classifying power of the motif (U/n1n2 where n1 and n2 are the size of the two samples - motif and bg)
		cohend= effect size, i.e. the z-score of the mean model score if the population is assumed to be the background
		cohenU3= probability that a sample with the motif model mean is drawn from a different distribution than that of the background
		pvalueHG=pvalue of the hypergeometric test. The population size is the sum of input and bg size, the successes in the population is the input size (usually is lower),
			the sample size is the number of RNAs with the motif 
			and the successes in the sample is the number of RNAs with the motif that originally belonged to the input.
			In this way the null hypothesis is that we are drawing the sample randomly from the original distribution.
		score= BEAM score, it is the sum of the individual partial scores of motif istances
		coverage= fraction of RNA in the input containing the motif
		fall-out= fraction of the background RNAs with a score that is at least 90% of the mean motif model score (False Positive Rate)
		runtime(s)= seconds took for this motif to be computed and completed		
		
		###NOTE for .nuc files the substitution matrix is a (3,-2), 3 for identities and -2 otherwise.


	benchmark/motifs/
		It contains the majority of the information created with BEAM, motifs, models and statistics.
		** cross_analysis.txt (from BEAM 2.0) :
			Cooccurrence matrix between models (asymmetrical matrix): 
				sequenceN is the Nth motif in sequence (if -N t is specified)
				structureN is the Nth motif in structure
				the rowToColumn information is the fraction of RNAs containing Row motif that contain Column motif as well
				
			Mutual Information MI between models (symmetrical matrix):
				sequenceN is the Nth motif in sequence (if -N t is specified)
				structureN is the Nth motif in structure
				the rowToColumn information is the Mutual Information between the two models, 
				computed with binary vectors with 1s if the RNA had the motif and 0 otherwise.

		
				
		** <baseName>_m<mask>_run<run>.search.txt : RNAs found with a search of the model in the dataset + background.
			<mask> is the motif number, <run> is the number identifying the parallel starting point if -R was specificied, otherwise is 1.
			The background instances have a "_bg" appended at the end of the name and are presented first in list.
			+ PFM + other data.
			
			FORMAT (divided in sections):
				#1:
					BEAR	ID(_bg)$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
					...
					BEAR	ID$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore

				#2 starting with "#otherMatches":
					left for future data

				#3 starting with "#Seq PSSM": (these are the nucleotides underlying the structure model)
					Nucleotides	ID(_bg)$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
					...
					Nucleotides	ID$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore

				#4 starting with "#DB": (these are the dot-brackets underlying the structure model)
					DotBracket	ID(_bg)$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
					...
					DotBracket	ID$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore

				#5 starting with "#PSSM": (more a PFM to be precise, it reflects the multiple alignment found in #1)
					BEARcharacter : relative frequency in the column	BEARcharacter2 : relative frequency ...
					...

				then	
				#score : here is 0.0 (the model score is int the model file)
				#seq : number of matching sequences found
				#width : motif width (corresponds to the model's)
				the other parameters are set to default values for these files.
			
			
		<baseName>_m<mask>_run<run>.txt : the RNAs windows used to create the motif model + PFM + other data. This is before searching the dataset for motif instances.
			FORMAT:
				as the former but with
				#escape : True if run reached convergence
				#onStep : step of convergence or total number of steps done
				#minSteps : -s option
				#maxSteps : -S option
				
		<baseName>_m<mask>_run<run>.search.txt.gauss : deprecated
	
	
	webLogoOut/motifs/
		fasta files in qBEAR (quickBEAR) to use with WebLogo. The suggested command is 
		    ./weblogo -a 'ZAQXSWCDEVFRBGTNHY' -f <weblogo.fa> -D fasta -o <out.eps> --composition="none" -C red ZAQ 'Stem' -C blue XSW 'Loop' -C forestgreen CDE 'InternalLoop' -C orange VFR 'StemBranch' -C DarkOrange B 'Bulge' -C lime G 'BulgeBranch' -C purple T 'Branching' -C limegreen NHY 'InternalLoopBranch'


	distance/ (BEAM 2.0, requires python)
		contains plots with the distribution of the distances of pairs of motif models (distance from motif starts).
		The wording is like this: number only for structure models, number+"n" for sequence models.
			In this sense: "1n3" means the distance between model 1 in sequence and model 3 in structure (specifically 1n MINUS 3)
				"23" is structure 2 minus structure 3 and so on. 
		The ones with single peaks are reported at the end of the run and analysed in the "distance_peaks.txt" file ../
		You should check "distance_peaks.txt" before going through these plots (which may be misleading because of the null distribution)
		
	distance_peaks.txt
		for all the pairs with single distance peaks, a Kolmogorov Smirnov test with p-value and statistic reported.
		Remember that the null distribution of (a-b) where a and b are two uniform distributed variables is pyramid shaped so look at the p-value to see if they are significant
		A mean distance is reported (that is, the position of the peak).
		E.g. a significant peak at -20 means that the two models are found consistently at a distance of 20 nt 
			...startOfA--------------------startOfB---------...
	MI.png
	Cooccurrence.png : 
		contains grids with fancy representations for the cross_analysis.txt file. The colour scale is matched with the MI and Cooccurrence range.
