## WORK IN PROGRESS (BEAM 2.0 friendly)
Upon completion of a run, a folder named "results" will be created in the same path of your BEAM executable.
Within the "results" folder, all the runs' folders will be stored with the SAME BASENAME OF THE INPUT FILE.

e.g. if you called BEAM with "-f important_data.fb ... " 
	you will find a folder with this path: 
		results/important_data/
		
The structure of the results folder is the following:
results/
	<fileBaseName>/
		cooccurrence.png
		MI.png
		<backgroundFile>
		<inputFile>
		distance_peaks.txt
		<baseName>_summary.nuc.txt
		<baseName>_summary.txt
		benchmark/
			motifs/
			(mask<N>/ if -k T)
		webLogoOut/
			motifs/
			(mask<N>/ if -k T)			
		distance/
			
Description of each element (a prepending "**" means that it stores a good amount of the information one is probably looking for:

	benchmark/motifs/
		It contains the majority of the information created with BEAM, motifs, models and statistics.
		
		<baseName>_m<mask>_run<run>.txt : the RNAs windows used to create the motif model + PFM + other data. This is before searching the dataset for motif instances.

				
		**<baseName>_m<mask>_run<run>.search.txt : RNAs found with a search of the model in the dataset + background.
			The background instances have a "_bg" appended at the end of the name and are presented first in list.
			+ PFM + other data.
			
		FORMAT (divided in sections):
			#1:
				BEAR	ID(_bg)$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
				...
				BEAR	ID$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
			
			#2 starting with "#otherMatches":
				left for future data
			
			#3 starting with "#Seq PSSM": (these are the nucleotides underlying the structure model)
				Nucleotides	ID(_bg)$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
				...
				Nucleotides	ID$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
				
			#4 starting with "#DB": (these are the dot-brackets underlying the structure model)
				DotBracket	ID(_bg)$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
				...
				DotBracket	ID$subopt	RNAlength	motifStart	motifEnd	partialScore
				
			#5 starting with "#PSSM": (more a PFM to be precise, it reflects the multiple alignment found in #1)
				BEARcharacter : relative frequency in the column	BEARcharacter2 : relative frequency ...
				...
			
			then	
			#score : here is 0.0 (the model score is int the model file)
			#seq : number of matching sequences found
			#width : motif width (corresponds to the model's)
			the other parameters are set to default values for these files.
